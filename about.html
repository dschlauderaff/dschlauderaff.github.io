<p>I am a former retail store manager working on a career transition to full stack web development. I have recently re-discovered my love of programming and I am now taking the steps needed to turn that into a career. I want to do more with my life, and I'm looking for the way. The name of the blog comes from a quote by Miyamoto Musashi: "If you know the way broadly you will see it in everything."</p>
