Why did I decide to join the Flatiron School? Why coding? 

After high school, I received a scholarship to attend the local community college. It wasn't glamorous, and it wasn't far away from home, which I thought was my top selection criteria. It was, however, paid for, which turned out to be the true top selection criteria. I thought I was going to be an engineer, so I took the math and hard science courses recommended. There was a 2 semester course on Object Oriented C++ available. It wasn't required, but it counted toward my transfer transcript, so I picked it up.

It wasn't a revalation. No trumpet fanfare, or pool of light, or anything of the sort. It was an okay class, I did well, and I enjoyed the time I spent in the lab coding with the other folks in the class. It did lead to my first real job, as an intern and later associate programmer with a software developer working under contract for the U.S. Navy. I helped create a workflow tracking system for the Naval Oceanographic Office. Beyond the work, I enjoyed the team environment, helping more experienced lead designers build out this complicated system. I stayed with that company for a few years, through one false-start at university, before leaving to finish my degree at Louisiana State University.

I got my bachelor's degree in kinesiology, after dropping engineering and picking kinesiology seemingly at random, now that I look back on it. I enjoyed the subject matter, and healthcare seemed like a decent choice for a career. But by the time I had my degree, the thought of another couple of years in med school was unbearable. There happened to be an entry level management position in the bookstore I was working for at the time. I applied, got the job, and have been with Barnes & Noble ever since.

And now I've reached a point in my career where all the options for advancement are extremely unappealing. I don't enjoy my job the way I once did, and until recently I've always thought "This next promotion will fix what's bothering me", but it hasn't, and I've had to spend a great deal of time trying to figure out what to do next.

I knew tech was the place to start. I've always been a tech guy. I talked with several professional acquaintances, trying to understand what they did, and if it would be a good fit for me. I needed something that would let me train while keeping my day job, and something that wouldn't be a pay downgrade if I did switch. I tried a few websites, like codeacademy, doing their html lessons, but it didn't really click. The I found Flatiron and their Learn platform. I tried the intro to Ruby course, and this time, I think there was a little pool of light.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed working with code. This was something I could learn to do that would be flexible with my schedule, and allow me to move back to a type of office environment that I had previously had before working retail. 

So why am I learning to code? Because it's fun, because I want to be part of that type of work space again, and because I want my career to be about more than gross margin reports and textbook return cycles. I want to be done with the never-ending cycle of retail store management, and to use the skills learned there and the new ones acquired through Flatiron to do something meaningful with my career. I'm learning to code because I want to enjoy working again.
