Started learning about hashes, what their use is and how to manipulate them. Hashes can be used to store related data using keys and values. For example, information about a person can be stored as a hash: dave_hash {height: 6'3, weight: 220, looks: devilishly handsome, ... et cetera}

Hashes can be nested, and contain other hashes or arrays. These can be manipulated by chaining together the keys until you are calling the value that you want to change and then set equal to a new value. One thing that I am unclear on is how to change a value in a hash that is nested in array that is further nested inside a hash. Something I'll look into tomorrow.

I set up my laptop to dual-boot in windows 10 and elementary, a linux distribution. I've heard friends and co-workers over the years talk about linux, but I've never felt the need to go down the rabbit hole myself. The Learn IDE for windows is a great tool for the absolute beginner that I was, to get started coding, but over time, the little annoyances and crashes with the remote terminal wore me down. Enjoying it so far, elementary is styled to look a lot like a mac OS, which I have experience with, and the coding is much smoother in this environment.
